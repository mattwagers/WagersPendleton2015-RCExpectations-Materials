# To generate SRCs.txt (all subject relative clauses)

SBAR=RC < WHNP=wh > NP=container : =container > S=environment : =container < NP=head : =wh . VP=vp

## In plain English. Numbered condition : by : condition. All dominance and precedence relations are immediate.

## 1. Find an SBAR that dominates a WHNP and is dominated by an NP. Label the SBAR 'RC', the WHNP 'wh', and the NP 'container'.
## 2. Identify the S that dominates the container NP and label it 'environment'.
## 3. Identify the head of the container NP and label it 'head'.
## 4. WHNP must immediately precede a VP (labeled 'vp').

# To generate ORCs.txt (all object relative clauses)

SBAR=RC < WHNP=wh > NP=container : =container > S=environment : =container < NP=head : =RC < S=embedded : =wh . NP=subject

## 1-3. Same as SRCs (all)
## 4. Find the S dominated by RC and label it 'embedded'
## 5. WHNP must immediately precede an NP (label it subject).
### N.B. 5 generates some false positive ORCs [see text]

# ADJUNCTS

# To generate XP_SRCs.txt (subject relative clauses with RC-initial adjuncts)

SBAR=RC < WHNP=wh > NP=container : =container > S=environment : =container < NP=head : =RC < S=embedded : =embedded < PP=XP : =wh . =XP : =XP . VP

## 1-3. Same as all SRcs.
## 4. Identify the S contained inside RC and label it 'embedded'.
## 5. The embedded S must dominate a PP (label it 'XP')
## 6. WHNP must precede XP.
## 7. ...which must precede VP

# To generate XP_ORCs.txt (object relative clauses with RC-initial adjuncts)

SBAR=RC < WHNP=wh > NP=container : =container > S=environment : =container < NP=head : =RC < S=embedded : =embedded < PP=XP : =wh . =XP : =XP . NP=subject : =subject . VP

## 1-6. Same as Adjunct SRCs
## 7. XP must precede an NP (labeled 'subject')
## 8. Subject NP must precede VP
